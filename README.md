# 🧠 Basic Function Projects

Put your JavaScript skills to the test by building simple but powerful functions. This series of exercises is designed to reinforce foundational JavaScript concepts like parameters, return values, conditionals, and loops.

## ✅ Goal

Complete all four function-based challenges listed below. Each script (`exerciseA.js` to `exerciseD.js`) contains a problem statement and function stubs to be implemented.

## 🧪 Exercises Overview

| Challenge                | Status     | Description                                |
|--------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Basic Functions Exercise A | ❌ Not Passed | Simple arithmetic or return function       |
| Basic Functions Exercise B | ❌ Not Passed | String manipulation or conditional logic   |
| Basic Functions Exercise C | ❌ Not Passed | Loops or iteration-based transformation    |
| Basic Functions Exercise D | ❌ Not Passed | Combined logic or slight algorithmic twist |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-function-projects.git
   cd basic-function-projects
``

2. Open each `.js` file and follow the instructions in the comments.

3. Run and test your code:

   ```bash
   node exerciseA.js
   ``

## 📌 Notes

* Focus on clean, readable code.
* Use `console.log()` statements to test and debug.
* Do **not** use external libraries — stick to vanilla JavaScript.

## 🧠 Keep Practicing

Once done, challenge yourself:

* Refactor solutions to be more efficient.
* Add automated tests using Node.js or Jest.
* Try to implement similar functions using different logic patterns.
